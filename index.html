                    </h2>
                    <p class="leading-relaxed">First of all, Munirah enjoys making friends. Her chill and friendly attitude make others attracted to her. She is just too kind that I can't even describe. She loves her family very much. Specially her father is a good friend of her. Then there is a cute little one called Aysha. Munirah loves to play with her. Munirah loves talking and she is a good listener. Munirah loves to listen songs. Specially nightcore songs are awesome. She loves to be happy and make others happy too. She enjoy go outside with her brother abrar. And one other thing she loves her hijab too much. If you messed up her hijab she will be pretty mad I guess. She loves to give others nicknames. She loves to listen compliments about her.</p>

                    <p class="leading-relaxed">Her food list is quite interesting. First, when she goes outside she will definitely have Fucchka. On occasion, She will have Biriani, backed pasta and our traditional Bangla food like (fish fry daal vorta and vaat). And one other thing, Munirah doesn't like sweets. Maybe because she is too sweet that her body can't take any more sweets.</p>

                    <p class="leading-relaxed">How we met : One day while giving a speaking test in Didar Sir's class, I suddenly saw Munirah speaking smoothly and confidently in front of the camera for the first time. And yes, I keep swallowing the words! I kept thinking that if I could talk like this! After that, I send friend requests to Munirah like all other classmates. After that Eid came, so I send Eid Mubarak to everyone including Munirah. But there is no replay. Then a few days later our final came and 3 days before the presentation of the final Munirah suddenly gave me a message. And said you are the only person I haven't introduced yet. So the first time I heard it and I didn't reply to the message. Later Munirah gives a message again! I was listening to music. After a while, I gave a replay. At the beginning of the conversation, She offered to make me a brother, but I said why can't we be friends? Surprisingly, Munirah easily agreed. After that, it felt very good to talk to her. We started to be a little better friends. After that, sometimes I was a little angry with her. But I fix the problems immediately. It goes on like this. Then suddenly one day Munirah tells me to be her best friend. I am very happy and surprised. Because I have never had a female best friend before! So I do my best to keep this friendship going. After that our understanding started to get better. Then slowly Munirah started trusting me, started sharing her feelings. And on January 4, 2021, I spoke to Munirah on the first phone. And this is my first time talking to a girl for so long. Now Munirah understands me better than she and I understand her better than me. And finally, I just want to let you know that no matter what happens your Rakib is always there for you. No matter how bad the situation is I will always there for you for the rest of my life.</p>
